# Final Capstone

Through scrum meetings and sprints, collaborated in a team of five on a full stack web application. Designed and created an application utilizing PostgreSQL, Vue, Java and Spring Boot. The application facilitated external Marvel API browsing, as well as stored user data and collection specific information in a unique database.

# Back End

The back end database was created using PostgreSQL on PGAdmin4. This database communicates with Java containers.

# Middle Tier

The middle tier utilized Java and Spring Boot, as well as Vue, to accomodate an external and internal API. Via connection to Marvel's Dev API, the web application can search for, add, and delete specific comics.

# Front End

The font end is a combination of Vue, Html, JavaScript and CSS. These elements enable user interaction.
